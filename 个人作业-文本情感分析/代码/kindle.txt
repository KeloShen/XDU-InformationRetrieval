I love my kindle
The battery life is amazing
The screen is too small
I am not satisfied with the customer service
The device is easy to use
It is a bit expensive
Reading on kindle is comfortable
The font size is adjustable
Sometimes it crashes
Delivery was fast
The design is simple and elegant
I wish it had more storage
The user manual is not clear
I enjoy reading every day
It is just okay
